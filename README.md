# Interprex 
This is a basic interpreter where you can program some things.
The program can accept different data structures like
<ul>
  <li>if else conditional</li>
  <li>for loop</li>
  <li>while loop</li>
</ul>
and can solve opertions like
<ul>
  <li>Sum</li>
  <li><Multiplication/li>
  <li>Division</li>
  <li>Exponen</li>
</ul>

    
You can create any type of variable using
```
    var your_var = your_value;
```
data types like double, float, ints and strings are accepted.

    
## Execution
The program will execute the prompt when you run the interpreter file without any input.
If theres an input file it has to be a text file and there will be an output.
```
example_text.txt 
```
